TASK 1: A JavaScript file named arrayManipulation.js is created with a function processArray to take an array of numbers as an argument and return a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number
is tripled.

TASK 2: A function formatArrayStrings is added in arrayManipulation.js and it takes two arrays as arguments (1. An array of strings. 2. An array of numbers processed by processArray.) and the function also modifies each string based on its corresponding number: (1. Capitalize the entire string if the number is even. 2. Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd).

TASK 3: A file called userInfo.js is created with a function called createUserProfiles that: (1. Takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. 2. Returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName,
and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).)
